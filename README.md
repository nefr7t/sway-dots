- fuzzel
- swayidle
- gtklock

In order for brightness controls to function properly, you must add yourself into "video" and "input" group.

`sudo usermod -a -G video,input USER`

In order to use the custom fastfetch config, run `fastfetch` with an option to a custom config file. (In this dotfiles, a minimal custom file showing Tsukasa Tenma as logo is included)

`fastfetch -c /path/to/config/file/tsukasa.jsonc`
